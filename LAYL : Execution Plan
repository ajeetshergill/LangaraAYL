  S// The 3 golden circles. Why, How, What... Let's follow this thing.
  S//Let us try to use as simple wordings as possible. Like don't use Self education. I don't know what does it mean here.
  
>>>>>>>>>>>Day 1<<<<<<<<<<
- its place where anyone can be anyone and no limits.
  E//A place where you meet like minded people and be what you want to be.
  
- where we can help each other grow by giving wisdom and sharing our knowledge.
  IC//E//What kind of knowledge are we talking about ??
  
- teaching how to be leader , showing anyone can be leader and age is just number
  //Not showing, taking out the leader inside you. 
      //What does leader mean.
          //Take lead of your life.
          
- why do we need it ? because most of young people have so many problems and chained with society
its time to be free.
    //It's time to live for your own.
    
- we dont have young leaders as we are said you need to age to experience , have wisdome and to find passion 
  that you have all the time in the world. and we young people are looking for excuse to get in comfort zone back ,
  we use it the saying the elder people say it which is we have all the time in the world to find it. so we never find it.
  its time to train our minds so that we reject it. as now we have tools to experince everything. its possible
   //Not clear what was just said.
   
- teach optimism and confidence because they are skills we need most in this world
  //Your life starts with how you see them.

- what do we stand for helping people


>>>>>>>>>>>Day 2<<<<<<<<<<
- educating young people about importance of self development.
- all wanna succeed but few does because most of them are lost and dont who they are - so if you wanna succed
you must know who are you

- even if you wanna be doctor you need to know who you are , work on your self skills so that you succeed in life as life is not easy game.
- Good habits lead to success ) model succesful people and chances of you being also increases
it's easy to form bad habit or addiction and it's takes two things to form good habits
